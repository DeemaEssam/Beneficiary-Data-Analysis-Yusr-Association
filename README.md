# Beneficiary-Data-Analysis-Yusr-Association

I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard as part of operational tasks, aiming to transform raw data into clear indicators that support administrative planning and performance monitoring.
The dashboard enables:

- Analysis of monthly trends in the number of beneficiaries and family counseling requests
- Insights into beneficiary distribution by gender (male / female)
- Analysis of the most requested types of family counseling services
- Measurement of initiative impact through the number of beneficiaries per initiative
